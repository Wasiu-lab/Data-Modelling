## *Introduction to Dimensional Data Modeling*

Dimensional data modeling is a design methodology primarily used in data warehousing and analytics systems. It organizes data into structures that are intuitive, query-friendly, and optimized for decision-making processes. Unlike traditional normalized databases, which focus on reducing redundancy, dimensional models prioritize readability and performance in analytical queries.

At its core, dimensional data modeling transforms raw data into meaningful insights by focusing on the "who," "what," "when," and "where" of a business process. This is achieved through its two main components:

 **Dimension Tables:**  
   These provide context to the facts, storing descriptive attributes such as product names, customer demographics, or game locations. Dimensions enable filtering, grouping, and labeling data for better insights.

### Why Use Dimensional Data Modeling?

- **Enhanced Query Performance:**  
  Pre-aggregated and denormalized structures reduce the complexity of joins and speed up analytical queries.

- **Business-Friendly Design:**  
  The intuitive structure makes it easier for non-technical users to understand and explore data.

- **Scalability:**  
  Handles large volumes of data efficiently and adapts well to evolving business needs.

- **Focus on Decision-Making:**  
  Provides a framework tailored for answering specific business questions, enabling better decision-making.

### Applications of Dimensional Data Modeling

1. **Business Intelligence (BI):**  
   - Designing dashboards and reports for sales, marketing, finance, and supply chain analysis.
   
2. **Performance Tracking:**  
   - Monitoring KPIs like player performance in sports, customer churn, or sales trends.

3. **Predictive Analytics:**  
   - Feeding structured data into machine learning models for forecasting and trend analysis.

4. **Data-Driven Decision Making:**  
   - Empowering organizations with actionable insights for strategic planning.

This repository demonstrates practical implementations of dimensional data modeling concepts through SQL scripts that focus on maintaining historical data, creating graph-based models, and enabling efficient updates for analytical purposes.
## Dimensional Data Modeling with SQL: A Practical Approach

# Overview

Dimensional data modeling is a method used to design databases optimized for querying and reporting. It involves creating data structures (facts and dimensions) to represent and analyze business processes effectively.

This repository demonstrates various approaches to dimensional data modeling using SQL, with examples related to player statistics, incremental data updates, and graph data modeling for basketball datasets.

## Files and Explanation

### 1. **Cumulative Table Design**
   **File:** `Cumulative Table design class example.sql`

   **Purpose:**  
   - To maintain a cumulative record of player statistics by appending new season data while preserving historical data.
   - Utilizes arrays and custom types to store statistics and classify players into scoring categories.

   **Key Features:**  
   - Custom types (`season_stat`, `scoring_classes`).
   - Full outer join to merge current season data with existing records.
   - Categorizes players (e.g., "star," "good") based on their points per game.

   **Steps to Execute:**  
   - Create custom types and the `player_table` schema.
   - Insert new data using the provided query, which handles updates and inserts seamlessly.

   **Objective:**  
   Efficiently maintain a longitudinal dataset that tracks player performance across seasons.

### 2. **Graph Data Modeling**
   **File:** `Graph data Model using the NBA database.sql`

   **Purpose:**  
   - To structure basketball data as a graph with vertices (players, teams, games) and edges (relationships such as "plays_in" or "shares_team").
   - Use of `json` properties to add flexibility to vertex and edge metadata.

   **Key Features:**  
   - Custom `vertex_type` and `edge_type` enums for defining graph elements.
   - Queries to insert vertex and edge data from relational tables.

   **Steps to Execute:**  
   - Define the `vertices` and `edges` tables.
   - Populate vertices with game, player, and team data using `json_build_object`.
   - Add edges to represent relationships like "plays_in" or "plays_against."

   **Objective:**  
   Facilitate complex network analysis, such as finding connections between players or analyzing team dynamics.

### 3. **Incremental Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**
   **File:** `Increamental scd query.sql`

   **Purpose:**  
   - Handle incremental updates for Slowly Changing Dimensions (Type 2 SCD).
   - Ensure the database reflects changes in player status or scoring class over time.

   **Key Features:**  
   - CTEs to separate new, unchanged, and changed records.
   - Unnesting arrays for detailed tracking of attribute changes.

   **Steps to Execute:**  
   - Use CTEs (`last_season_scd`, `this_season_data`, etc.) to manage data transitions.
   - Run the query to update the SCD table with new and changed records.

   **Objective:**  
   Ensure accurate historical tracking of player attributes for analytical consistency.

---

### 4. **Players SCD Table Initialization**
   **File:** `Player_scd Table.sql`

   **Purpose:**  
   - Create and populate the `players_scd` table with historical records.
   - Define streaks for periods when attributes like scoring class or activity status remain unchanged.

   **Key Features:**  
   - SQL window functions (`LAG`, `SUM`) for identifying changes.
   - Grouping and streak identifiers to create a time-series view of data.

   **Steps to Execute:**  
   - Define the `players_scd` table schema.
   - Run the query to populate the table using historical player data.

   **Objective:**  
   Provide a solid foundation for tracking player data as it evolves across seasons.

## Getting Started

1. **Environment Setup**  
   - Ensure PostgreSQL or a compatible SQL environment is installed.
   - Import the provided SQL scripts sequentially based on dependencies.

2. **Data Sources**  
   - Ensure access to tables like `player_seasons`, `game_details`, and `teams` for testing queries.

3. **Execution Order**  
   - Start with the `Player_scd Table.sql` script to initialize the table.
   - Use the other scripts (`Cumulative Table Design` and `Incremental SCD`) to update and maintain the database.

## Applications

- **Data Warehousing:** Efficiently maintain historical records for business intelligence.
- **Graph Analysis:** Explore complex relationships in sports data.
- **Performance Tracking:** Analyze player trends and team dynamics.
